# Interactions交互

交互模块输出关于用户交互的信息\(触摸, 滑动, 关键点按\)在viewer查看器里。通过在图层上按下 Touch 按钮或者通过在模块库里面搜索模块来添加交互动作。

## 交互模块

* **Interaction**`I`This is the bread and butter of interaction in Origami. It can tell you when a user touches down or taps on a particular layer. It also provides the position of the touch within its parent group, and the amount of force applied when using a laptop, phone, or tablet that supports 3D Touch.

* **Scroll **This is another common interaction in Origami. It lets you scroll a layer vertically or horizontally, with customizable physics. It can be set to Paging mode, which is useful for prototyping carousels.

* **Pop Switch** This helps you quickly prototype a two-state, swipeable interaction \(ex: swiping a card left and right\). It also supports two-finger pinching in addition to swipes.

* **Long Press** and **Double Tap** Captures long presses and double taps when connected to an Interaction patch.

* **Drag** Make any layer draggable.

* **Keyboard** `K` This shows whenever a key is pressed in the viewer.

* **Hover** Allows you to capture hover interaction with a mouse.
